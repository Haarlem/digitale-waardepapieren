# This proof of concept

This proof of concept is made to digitise an existing common process for the City of Haarlem: in order to register with a social housing cooperative a citizen needs to present them with a 'proof of registration'. This currently involves the citizen going to city hall to get their certificate of 'proof of registration' and then take this to the housing cooporation.

This project proofs that this can all be done with digital certificates – or [verifiable claims](https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/) – citizens can print themselves.

## Why we've chosen a digital 'proof of registration' as a proof of concept

Blockchain technologies have a lot of potential in government applications. We would like to explore these applications. However to prove the case any proof of concept needs to adhere to these criteria:

* Solve a real problem for the public administration
* Have a good financial business model
* Be low risk
* Have potential for national Dutch implementation

The process of getting a 'proof of registration' is a mostly paper process. Although the citizen can request a 'proof of registration' they will have to go to city hall to identify themselves, pay €25 in fees and receive the paper document.

Thus we've decided on building a proof of concept for [the digitisation of the 'proof of registration'](scenario.md) using [blockchain technologies](technologies.md).
