# Digitale Waardepapieren

This project is an example of how to use the [IOTA](iota.org) [tangle](https://learn.iota.org/faq/tangle) with [Discipl](https://discipl.org/) library to publish digital [verifiable claims](https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/). These digital certificates replace the certificates the City of Haarlem has to print on expensive forge-proof paper. Thus increasing the speed and decreasing the cost of our digital service delivery.

* [Why we've made this this Proof of Concept](docs/proof-of-concept.md)
* [The scenario this Proof of Concept fulfills](docs/scenario.md)
* [The technologies we use, why we've used them and how they work](docs/technologies.md)

## Components

This proof of concept is made out of three components that the three handle discrete steps set out in [the scenario](docs/scenario.md).

* [ClaimPage](./ClaimPage/README.md): A webserver that hosts the web-page where citizens can download their certificate.
* [ClaimServer](./ClaimServer/README.md): A server for the public administration that can handle the claim for a certificate and return it to the client of the _ClaimPage_.
* [Scanner](./Scanner/README.md): A webserver that hosts the web-app that can be used to scan the generated QR code and verify the certificate.

## How to install and run

We've 2 separate docker-compose files for both development and production.
For both environments you need [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).

### Development and Proof of Concept

Development mode is easy to set up with just 1 command, the Docker VM will also autoreload when making changes.
The full stack can be obtained and started by doing the following:

  - Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
  - When done, you can access:
    - [City demo page](http://localhost:8080)
    - [Scanner (for phone)](http://localhost:8081)
    - [Claim Server (API)](http://localhost:8082)

### Production

For production, we'll only spawn the claim server, the rest (scanner and city demo page) should be hosted using a well-optimized static file server, like Nginx.

This manual assumes you've got a working version of NodeJS (min v6) installed.

  - Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d`
  - `cd` to the directories ClaimPage and Scanner, and do the following steps in each:
    - Run `npm install`
    - Run `npm run build`
    - Now you can use the output in the dist-folder to host said page. The files in dist are static, so a simple static file server would suffice.
